abstract: Perpetrators of cybercrime exploit the increase in text-based communication platforms and the associated anonymity. However, whenever a person is online, they inadvertently leave a digital footprint. In this dissertation, we explore the potential for using stylometry, i.e., linguistic style, as a cognitive biometric trait to identify a person. To use stylometry as a biometric trait, representation of style needs to independent of genre or topic and purely indicative of stylistic traits. We investigate different aspects of a language that can be used to represent the style. Specifically, we explore the role of structural and lexical information in representing style using cross-domain data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale cross-domain stylometric analysis in literature. From our experiments, we observed that low-level lexical features are more effective in representing style compared to syntactic features, specifically for internet data where text lengths are short. However, large-scale identification is still challenging with all representations. We further investigate whether stylometry exhibits essential biometric characteristics. First, we explore the uniqueness of stylometry using Biometric menagerie which gives insights into using stylometry as a biometric trait in large-scale settings. We observed that not all users exhibit a unique linguistic style and some users can easily be impersonated or impersonate others. Next, we investigate the permanence of linguistic style using data which spans over 24 months. We observed that only a few users exhibit consistent style for over 24 months while most other users drift beyond six months. Next, we investigate the potential for using stylometry along with another co-occurring trait, keystroke dynamics. We observed that multimodal authentication using both traits improved performance and limited by users with too few samples. Finally, we investigate the role of psychological and social aspects of language use that can help infer attributes like gender, age and personality traits of a person which is useful when large-scale identification is challenging. We observed that many psycholinguistic words correlated with these attributes and used as salient features for estimating them.
